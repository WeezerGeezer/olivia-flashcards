## ANTIMICROBIAL TERMINOLOGY

### Key Concepts (p.1-2)

**Empiric vs. Definitive Therapy:**
- **Empiric:** Therapy before causative organism known; based on common pathogens
- **Definitive:** Once cultures and sensitivities back

**Bactericidal vs. Bacteriostatic:**
- **Bactericidal:** Number of bacteria decrease when exposed
- **Bacteriostatic:** Number stays the same when exposed

**Synergy:**
- 1 + 1 = more than 2; or 1 + 0 = more than 1
- Team is better than sum of its parts

**Pharmacokinetics (PK):**
- "What the body does to the drug"
- Absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion

**Pharmacodynamics (PD):**
- "What the drug does to the body" (to the bug at site of action)
- Concentration-dependent or time-dependent killing

**Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MIC):**
- Lowest concentration that inhibits growth (bacteriostatic effect) in test tube
- Used to determine susceptibility (susceptible, intermediate, resistant)

### PK/PD Targets (p.3)

**T>MIC (Time above MIC):**
- Beta-lactams
- Macrolides
- Oxazolidinones
- **Optimization:** Extended or continuous infusions

**AUC/MIC:**
- Vancomycin
- Fluoroquinolones
- Tetracyclines
- **Optimization:** Optimize daily dose

**Cmax/MIC:**
- Aminoglycosides
- **Optimization:** High dose, extended interval dosing

### Antimicrobial Susceptibility (p.3)

**Susceptible:**
- PK/PD targets achievable
- Expect clinical success with common doses

**Intermediate:**
- MICs elevated for organism
- MIGHT see success with dose-optimization strategies

**Resistant:**
- PK/PD targets not obtainable
- Would NOT expect clinical success

### Steps for Selecting Antimicrobials (p.4)
1. Have a working diagnosis
2. Know common pathogens for expected infection
3. Consider patient-specific factors (allergies, previous antibiotics, end-organ disease, history drug-resistant pathogens)
4. Obtain appropriate diagnostic information (including cultures)
5. Start empiric antimicrobials targeting most likely pathogens
6. Await diagnostics
7. Streamline therapy based on culture information

### Resources (p.4)
- **Book:** Antibiotics Simplified (Gallagher and MacDougall) - App available

## ANTIMICROBIAL STEWARDSHIP

### Goals (p.4)
- Optimize clinical outcomes of patients with infectious diseases
  - Optimize appropriate use: selection, dose, route, duration
- Minimize unintended consequences:
  - Toxicity
  - Emergence of resistant pathogens (MRSA, VRE, MDR A. baumannii, P. aeruginosa)
  - Selection of superinfections (C. difficile, Candida spp.)
  - Reduce antimicrobial expenditure

### How Antibiotic Resistance Happens (p.4)
1. Lots of germs, few resistant to antibiotics
2. Antibiotics kill bacteria causing illness AND good bacteria protecting body
3. Antibiotic-resistant bacteria grow and take over
4. Some bacteria give resistance to other bacteria → more problems

### Impact of Resistance (p.5-6)

**Carbapenem Usage and CRE:**
- Chart shows correlation between carbapenem use and carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE) isolates

**Previous Antibiotic Exposure (p.5):**
- Independent impact in previous 90 days
- CRE vs. uninfected: OR 11.4
- CRE vs. ESBL: OR 5.2
- CRE vs. susceptible: OR 12.3

**Each Antibiotic Exposure Counts:**
- More exposures → higher odds ratio for resistance
- 0 exposures: OR 1
- 1 exposure: OR 1.43 (CIRE vs. CSE)
- 2 exposures: OR 2.05
- ≥3 exposures: OR 2.93

**Days of Therapy Matter (p.6):**
- Each additional day of antibiotics: OR 1.04 (1.01-1.06) for resistance

**Cost of Resistance (p.6):**
- MRSA bacteremia: 1.9x mortality, +2.2 days stay, +$6,916
- MRSA surgical infection: 3.4x mortality, +2.6 days, +$13,901
- VRE infection: 2.1x mortality, +6.2 days, +$12,766
- Resistant Pseudomonas: 3.0x mortality, +5.7 days, +$11,981
- Resistant Enterobacter: 5.0x mortality, +9 days, +$29,379
- **Total cost of antimicrobial resistance: ~$30 billion annually**

**Resistance Rates Increasing (p.6-7):**
- E. coli resistance to 3rd gen cephalosporins and fluoroquinolones trending upward
- S. pneumoniae resistance to fluoroquinolones and macrolides increasing
- Future projections show AMR could cause 10 million deaths/year by 2050

### C. difficile (p.7-8)
- 250,000 infections/year
- 14,000 deaths
- $1 billion in excess medical costs/year
- Threat level: URGENT

**Antibiotic Use and C. difficile (p.8):**
- Meta-analysis of 16 articles shows odds ratios:
  - 3rd gen cephalosporins: 3.20 (1.80-5.71)
  - Clindamycin: 2.86 (2.04-4.02)
  - 2nd gen cephalosporins: 2.23 (1.47-3.37)
  - Cefepime: 2.14 (1.47-3.52)
  - Carbapenems: 1.84 (1.26-2.68)
  - TMP-SMX: 1.78 (1.04-3.05)
  - FQs: 1.66 (1.17-2.35)
  - BLBLIs: 1.45 (1.05-2.02)
  - **Risk Ratio: 0.48 (0.38-0.62)** for stewardship programs

**Impact on Acute Kidney Injury (p.8):**
- Rate of AKI increases with each day of combination therapy
- Days 4-5 show peak risk (~20%)

**Need for Stewardship (p.8):**
- Outpatient: 30% inappropriate use
- Acute care: 50% inappropriate
- Long-term care: 70% inappropriate

### Putting Into Practice (p.8-9)

**Mission:**
- Optimize clinical outcomes
- Minimize unintended consequences

**Improving Outcomes (p.8):**
- Decreasing time to appropriate therapy = most important modifiable risk factor for mortality
- Sicker patient → more important to get active therapy ASAP
- Appropriate therapy good, optimal therapy better

**Empiric Therapy Guidelines (p.9):**
- Institution-specific (but should be similar)
- Based on: most likely pathogens, local susceptibilities (antibiogram), disease severity, formulary
- Do NOT neglect patient-specific factors

**Balancing Appropriateness and Overuse (p.9):**
- Example: HAP/VAP guidelines
  - Floor patient admitted ≤48 hours: Cefepime 2gm IV q8h + vancomycin IV
  - Recent pip/tazo or cefepime exposure (≥/= 48-72 hours): Meropenem 1gm IV q6h + vancomycin IV
  - Anaphylactic reaction to β-lactam: Aztreonam 2gm IV q8h + vancomycin IV
  - VAP or HAP in ICU ≤48 hours: Cefepime 2gm IV q8h + vancomycin IV + tobramycin IV
  - ICU >48 hours: Cefepime 2gm IV q8h + vancomycin IV + tobramycin IV

### Asymptomatic Bacteriuria (p.10)
- **#1 cause of inappropriate antimicrobial usage in hospital**
- Positive urine culture in absence of symptoms
- Altered mental status alone NOT diagnostic for UTI
- Pyuria = non-specific inflammation, occurs with indwelling catheters
- **Pyuria + asymptomatic bacteriuria NOT indication for treatment**

**Only treat when benefit:**
- Pregnancy
- Undergoing urological procedure (TURP)

**Treatment of asymptomatic bacteriuria:**
- Does NOT improve outcomes
- Associated with: ↑adverse events, ↑C. difficile, ↑antimicrobial resistance, ↑INCREASES recurrent UTIs

### Other Key Stewardship Interventions (p.10)
- Limit broad spectrum antibiotic use → De-escalation
- Duration of therapy → "Shorter is better"
- Dose optimization and TDM

## BETA-LACTAMS: GENERAL

### Major Mechanisms of Resistance (p.11)

**Antimicrobial Modifying Enzymes:**
- Beta-lactamases

**Target Site Alterations:**
- Penicillin Binding Protein (PBP) alterations

**Decreased Concentrations in Cell:**
- Efflux pumps
- Outer membrane porin down-regulation

### Beta-lactam Overview (p.11)

**General:**
- Most used antimicrobial class
- First-line for variety of infections, especially hospital
- First available 1940s with penicillin
- Several classes/generations: Penicillins, Cephalosporins, Carbapenems, Monobactams

**Mechanism of Action (p.11-12):**
- Inhibit final step of cell wall synthesis
- Block cross-linking of peptidoglycan
- Cross-linking essential for structural integrity
- Enzymes = penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs)
- **Easy to remember:** Penicillins (all β-lactams) bind to PBPs and block transpeptidation
- Not lethal itself, but starts process → rapid cell death

**Characteristics:**
- Bactericidal
- **Time-dependent antimicrobials**
  - Optimize time concentrations above MIC
  - Extended or continuous infusions
- Most well-studied, relatively non-toxic
- Use if we can
- De-escalate to narrowest spectrum with activity

---

## PENICILLINS

### Penicillin (p.12)

**Spectrum of Activity:**
- **Streptococci:** S. pyogenes, S. viridans, S. pneumoniae
- **Enterococci:** E. faecalis
- Treponema pallidum
- Mouth anaerobes (varying activity due to β-lactamases)

### Benzathine Penicillin (p.12)
- Long-acting depot preparation
- Must be given IM
- Slow steady release → low-level concentration for long period
- Only for very susceptible organisms (very low MIC)
- **Use:** Syphilis

### Beta-lactamases (p.13)
- Enzymes secreted by organism that hydrolyze β-lactam antibiotics
- Literally thousands identified
- Penicillinases, cephalosporinases, carbapenemases
- Most do NOT hydrolyze all β-lactams, but some do
- **Most common mechanism of β-lactam resistance in Gram-negative bacilli**
- Less common in Gram-positive

### S. aureus and Penicillin (p.13)
- Initially penicillin was DOC
- Even before market introduction, Staph created penicillinase
- Today: 20-30% isolates are PSSA (penicillin-susceptible S. aureus)

### Penicillin: Current Utility (p.13)
- **Syphilis:** DOC all stages, great efficacy, no resistance
- **Necrotizing fasciitis:** S. pyogenes
- **Dental coverage**
- **Definitive therapy:** Many streptococcal infections (endocarditis, pneumonia, etc.)

### Penicillinase-Resistant Penicillins (p.13)

**Agents:** Nafcillin, Methicillin, Oxacillin, Dicloxacillin

**"Antistaphylococcal penicillins":**
- Designed to overcome penicillinase
- Most common: Nafcillin or Oxacillin
- Methicillin not clinically used, BUT important for nomenclature (MSSA/MRSA)

**Activity:**
- Treatment of MSSA
- Streptococcal activity
- Lacks: Gram (-), enterococcus, anaerobic activity

### Staph PBP Alterations (p.13-14)
- PBPs with decreased affinity for β-lactams can occur
- In S. aureus: PBP2 → PBP2A alteration
- PBP2A can carry out transpeptidation even with β-lactams present
- **MRSA (Methicillin RESISTANT)**
- Confers resistance to all** β-lactams

### Aminopenicillins (p.14)

**Agents:** Ampicillin (IV), Amoxicillin (PO)

**Spectrum - HELPS bugs:**
- **H**. influenzae
- **E**. faecalis
- **L**. monocytogenes
- **P**. mirabilis
- **S**almonella and Shigella
- Penicillin-susceptible streptococci

**Clinical Uses:**
- **Enterococcal infections:**
  - Only bacteriostatic against E. faecalis
  - Limited activity against E. faecium
  - For life-threatening, deep-seeded infections (endocarditis, osteomyelitis): use with ceftriaxone or gentamicin for synergy
- **Meningitis:** High-dose ampicillin added when concerned for Listeria
- **Streptococcal infections**
- **Respiratory tract infections**
- β-lactamases can limit utility

### Piperacillin (p.14)
- Expands ampicillin coverage to include **P. aeruginosa**

**Clinical Pearl 1:** If enterococcus susceptible to ampicillin → also susceptible to piperacillin

**Clinical Pearl 2:** Piperacillin/tazobactam offers NO advantage over piperacillin for P. aeruginosa

- Not commercially available alone in US

### Penicillin/Beta-lactamase Inhibitor Combinations (p.14-15)

**Problem:** Penicillins very susceptible to β-lactamase by Gram (-) organisms and anaerobes → empiric therapy impractical

**Solution: Penicillin/BLI Combinations**

**Products:**
- **Amoxicillin/Clavulanic Acid (Augmentin)** - PO
- **Ampicillin/Sulbactam (Unasyn)** - IV
- **Piperacillin/Tazobactam (Zosyn)** - IV

**BLI adds:**
- Greater Gram (-) and anaerobic activity
- MSSA coverage

**Where These Fit:**

**Amoxicillin/Clavulanic Acid & Ampicillin/Sulbactam:**
- Empiric regimens for broad coverage in community-based infections
  - Caution: Increased Gram (-) resistance to ampicillin/sulbactam
- Good for respiratory tract infections (sinus, otitis, oral infections)
- Option for skin infections when MRSA not a concern
- Sulbactam has activity against Acinetobacter
- **Sulbactam/Durlobactam** - newer combination

**Piperacillin/Tazobactam:**
- Empiric, broad-spectrum therapy for nosocomial infections

### Penicillins: Common Adverse Events (p.15)

**Allergic Reactions:**
- Range from mild rash to anaphylaxis
- NOT related to β-lactam ring, but rather side chains (important for cross-reactivity discussions)

**Acute Interstitial Nephritis:**
- Can occur with all agents
- Most common with methicillin class
- Long-term penicillinase-resistant penicillins → high rates AKI

**Bone Marrow Suppression:**
- Rare (thrombocytopenia, neutropenia)
- Can occur with long courses

**Seizures:**
- Concern only with high doses/non-renally adjusted doses

**Gastrointestinal:**
- Particularly with clavulanic acid

### Penicillins: Drug Interactions (p.16)

**Minimal interactions overall**

**Probenecid:**
- Gout medication
- Blocks renal secretion, prolongs half-life

**Nafcillin:**
- CYP3A4 inducer

**Gram (-) Activity:**
- Generally poor
- Activity against "PEK" organisms - maybe
  - Proteus, E. coli, K. pneumoniae
  - Unreliable empirically for Gram (-) but good de-escalation agent
  - More likely active against community isolates → appropriate empirically for mild-moderate UTI
