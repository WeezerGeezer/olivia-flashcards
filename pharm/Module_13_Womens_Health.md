## COMBINED HORMONAL CONTRACEPTIVES (CHC)

### Mechanism of Action (p.2)
**Progestins (primary effect):**
- Thicken cervical mucus → prevent sperm penetration
- Slow tubal motility
- Delay sperm transport
- Induce endometrial atrophy
- Block LH surge → inhibit ovulation
- Suppress FSH release

**Estrogen:**
- Stabilize endometrial lining
- Provide cycle control

### Components (p.2-3)
**Estrogens:**
- Ethinyl estradiol (EE) - most common, 20-50 mcg
- Estradiol valerate
- Estetrol

**Progestins:**
- Synthetic progesterone (many available)
- Differ in estrogenic, antiestrogenic, androgenic effects

### Combined Oral Contraceptives (COC) (p.3)

**Types:**
- Monophasic vs multiphasic
- Extended-cycle: 84+ days active pills
- Continuous: pills taken 84+ days then 7 days inactive/estrogen-only

**Starting Methods (p.3):**
1. First day of cycle - start on day 1, backup 7 days
2. First Sunday - start first Sunday after cycle begins, backup 7 days
3. Quick start - start day of office visit, backup 7 days (most successful)

**Selection (p.3):**
- All similarly effective
- ≤35 mcg EE recommended without coexisting conditions
- Low androgenic for: oily skin, acne, hirsutism
- Monophasic: easier to manage AE or alter cycle timing
- Continuous: eliminate/decrease cycles per year

**Adverse Effects (p.3-4):**
- Early use (may improve by 3rd cycle): nausea, bloating, breakthrough bleeding
- Continue 2-3 months before changing unless serious
- Most common: irregular bleeding
- Skin breakouts with higher androgenic effects

**SERIOUS - Stop Immediately (ACHES) (p.4):**
- **A**bdominal pain (severe)
- **C**hest pain, SOB
- **H**eadache (severe), vision changes
- **E**ye problems (vision loss, diplopia)
- **S**evere leg pain/swelling

**Monitoring (p.4):**
- Patient symptoms
- Weight
- Visual inspection
- Depression screening
- Menstrual symptoms
- Blood pressure

### Medication Interactions (p.5)
**Decrease COC effectiveness:**
- Rifampin (major)
- Tetracyclines, penicillins (case reports)
- Anticonvulsants: phenobarbital, carbamazepine, phenytoin, lamotrigine
- HIV antiretrovirals
- St. John's Wort (OTC)

**Note:** Lower COC doses → more likely interactions affect effectiveness

### Eligibility Categories (p.5)
- Category 4: Unacceptable risk (do not use)
- Category 3: Risks usually outweigh advantages
- Category 2: Advantages generally outweigh risks
- Category 1: No restriction

### Patient Instructions (p.5-6)

- Benefits and that CHC don't protect against STI/STD
- When to start taking
- Emphasize compliance importance

**Missed Doses (p.6):**
- 1 tablet: take ASAP, continue rest as prescribed
- ≥2 tablets: take 1 missed tablet ASAP, discard others, continue
- If missed in last week of hormonal tablets: finish active tablets, skip hormone-free interval, start new pack
- Use backup contraception until 7 consecutive days of active tablets

**Vomiting/Diarrhea (p.6):**
- <48 hours: no redosing needed
- >48 hours: continue tablets; if in last week, skip hormone-free tablets and begin new pack
- Use backup until 7 consecutive days after symptoms subside

### Transdermal Contraceptives (p.6)

**Xulane:** 35 mcg EE + 150 mcg norelgestromin
- Effective in patients <90 kg

**Administration:**
- Apply to abdomen, buttocks, upper torso, or upper arm
- Change weekly x3 weeks, then week 4 patch-free
- Apply on same day each week

**Adverse Effects:**
- Application-site reactions
- Similar to COC: breast discomfort, headache, breakthrough bleeding, nausea
- ~60% more estrogen exposure than 35 mcg COC → increased thrombotic risk

**Missed Doses (p.6):**
- Off <24 hours: reapply (old or new), no backup needed
- Off >24 hours: start new 4-week cycle, backup x7 days
- If delayed in week 3: omit hormone-free week, apply new patch immediately

### Vaginal Rings (p.7)

**NuvaRing:** 15 mcg/day EE + 120 mcg/day etonogestrel

**Missed Doses (p.7):**
- Displaced <3 hours (NuvaRing) or <2 hours (Annovera): reinsert, no backup needed
- Displaced >3 hours (NuvaRing) or >2 hours (Annovera): reinsert immediately, backup x7 days

**Adverse Effects:**
- Similar to all CHC
- Specific: Annovera interacts with 1-3 day oil-based miconazole
- Possibility of increased VTE

### CHC Considerations (p.7)

**General:**
- Complete medical exam/Pap not necessary prior to CHC
- Medical history and BP required
- COC reduce risk of ovarian/endometrial cancer after 5+ years
- May reduce: ovarian cysts, ectopic pregnancy, PID, endometriosis, fibroids, benign breast disease
- Recommend condoms for STI/STD prevention

### CHC and Age >35 (p.7)
- Controversial; usually <30 mcg estrogen used
- May improve or decrease perimenopause/menopause symptoms
- May increase BMD
- Increased VTE risk, especially >40 yo
- No increased CV risk if low-dose, healthy/non-obese
- Increased breast cancer risk
- **Do NOT use** if >35 yo with: migraine with aura, uncontrolled HTN, smoking, diabetes with vascular disease

### CHC and Smoking (p.7-8)
- COC ≥50 mcg EE associated with MI in smokers
- Older patients at higher risk
- **Contraindicated:** >35 yo and smoke ≥15 cigarettes/day
- Consider progestin-only or nonhormonal

### CHC and Hypertension (p.8)
- CHC can increase BP 6-8 mmHg
- Increased risk MI and stroke
- Low-dose CHC okay in <35 yo with well-controlled/monitored HTN
- BP usually normalizes 3-6 months after D/C
- **Contraindication:** SBP ≥160 or DBP ≥100
- **Risk>benefit:** SBP 140-159 or DBP 90-99
- Drospirenone: increased K+ risk with K-sparing diuretics, ACE, ARB, aldosterone antagonists

### CHC and Dyslipidemia (p.8)
- Synthetic progestins: may ↓HDL, ↑LDL
- Estrogens: may ↓LDL, ↑HDL, moderately ↑TG
- Most low-dose CHC: no significant impact
- Can use CHC in dyslipidemia

### CHC and Diabetes (p.8)
- Low-dose products don't significantly alter insulin, glucose, or glucagon
- Doesn't alter HbA1c
- **Do NOT use** if diabetes with vascular disease or >20 years duration

### CHC and Migraine (p.8)
- May increase or decrease migraine frequency
- Higher stroke risk with migraine WITH aura
- Can consider in migraine WITHOUT aura
- Can use in non-migraine headaches
- **Do NOT use:** migraine WITH aura at any age → consider progestin-only

### CHC and Breast Cancer (p.8)
- Risk may be slightly elevated
- Benefits outweigh risks for healthy young patients
- >40 yo or elevated family history risk → consider alternatives
- **Do NOT use:** current or past breast cancer

### CHC and Thromboembolism (p.8-9)
- Estrogens increase VTE risk (DVT, PE)
- Higher risk with hypercoagulable states
- 3X increase in thromboembolism and mortality vs nonusers
- Third-generation (desogestrel, norgestimate) and fourth-generation (drospirenone) progestins: slightly higher VTE risk
- Transdermal patch and vaginal ring: increased risk due to continuous/higher estrogen exposure
- Progestin-only: no significant increase in venous/arterial events

### CHC and Obesity (p.9)
- Increased clearance and decreased serum concentrations
- More adipose tissue → hormonal sequestration → decreased free hormone → lower efficacy
- IUDs, implants, DMPA: low failure rates, safe in obese
- Copper IUD: most reliable in obese
- Generally CHC advantages outweigh risks
- If >35 yo and obese → progestin-only may be more appropriate

### CHC and Postpartum (p.9)
- Concern: hypercoagulability risks, effects on lactation

**Breastfeeding:**
- Avoid estrogen first 21 days postpartum
- Avoid estrogen 42 days if VTE risk factors, 30 days without risk factors

**Not breastfeeding:**
- Avoid estrogen 42 days if VTE risk factors, 21 days without risk factors
- After 42 days: no restrictions

### CHC and Return to Fertility (p.9)

---

## MENOPAUSE

### General Information (p.14)
- Permanent end of menstrual periods from loss of ovarian follicle activity
- Natural life stage, not a disease
- Stages: perimenopause → menopause → postmenopause (≥12 months after last menses)
- Average life expectancy ~81 years → over 1/3 of life in peri/postmenopause
- Induced menopause: surgery, chemo, radiation
- Symptoms vary → individualize treatment

### Epidemiology (p.14)
- Median age onset: 51.4 years (range 45-56)
- ~1% experience premature menopause (<40 yo)
- 6,000 women/day reach menopause in US
- By 2025: 1.1 billion postmenopausal worldwide
- ~40% of life spent postmenopausal

### Diagnosis (p.14)
**Clinical:** 12 consecutive months amenorrhea

**Perimenopause:** Irregular cycles, FSH fluctuates

**Menopause labs:**
- FSH elevated (often >40 IU/L) - not required for diagnosis
- Estradiol decreased (>90% reduction)

**Other tests (exclude other causes):**
- TSH, prolactin, iron studies, lipid profile, hCG

**Hysterectomy:** Rely on symptoms (hot flashes, GSM, sleep/mood changes)

### Etiology (p.14-15)
**Natural (Spontaneous):**
- Normal physiologic aging
- Gradual ovarian follicle depletion → decline estrogen/progesterone

**Induced:**
- Surgical: bilateral oophorectomy
- Iatrogenic: chemo or pelvic radiation → ovarian failure

**Premature:** Onset <40 yo, often due to primary ovarian insufficiency (POI)

### Pathophysiology (p.15)
- Born with ~2 million follicles; <500 ovulate, rest undergo atresia
- Decline in anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH) → marker of reduced ovarian reserve
- Progressive follicular loss → ↓estrogen and progesterone
- After menopause: ovary primarily produces androstenedione
- Loss of ovarian negative feedback → ↑FSH and LH
- Menopause: ~15-fold ↑FSH, 10-fold ↑LH, >90% ↓estradiol
- Hormonal fluctuations during perimenopause → irregular cycles

### Clinical Presentation (p.15)

**Perimenopause:** Abnormal uterine bleeding (anovulation)

**Menopause:** Permanent cessation of menses

**Vasomotor:**
- Hot flashes, sweating, night sweats
- Flash/flush lasts 1-30 minutes

**Other:**
- Sleep disturbances, mood changes, impaired memory/concentration
- Fatigue, myalgia/arthralgia, headaches, palpitations

**Genitourinary Syndrome (GSM):**
- Vaginal dryness, dyspareunia, dysuria, recurrent UTIs
- Sexual dysfunction common (42-88%)

**Labs:**
- FSH >10-12 IU/L (perimenopause, cycle day 2-3)
- Menopause: sustained ↑FSH (≥40 IU/L) - not required
- Additional: TSH, iron, prolactin, lipid profile, hCG

### Complications (p.15)
**Estrogen deficiency:**
- Cardiometabolic changes: ↑visceral fat, central obesity, lipid changes
- Bone loss → osteoporosis risk
- Cognitive complaints (brain fog, memory)
- Skin/hair changes (thinning, wrinkles, alopecia, hirsutism)

### Treatment Goals (p.15-16)
- Relieve symptoms
- Improve quality of life
- Lowest effective dose, shortest duration
- Reevaluate periodically
- Mild vasomotor → nonpharmacologic
- Moderate-severe → MHT unless contraindicated
- Vulvovaginal only → topical vaginal estrogen or nonhormonal lubricants

---

## MENOPAUSE NONPHARMACOLOGIC THERAPY

## MENOPAUSAL HORMONE THERAPY (MHT)

### Evidence-Based Guidelines (p.17-18)

**Key Recommendations:**
- Hormone therapy = gold standard for vasomotor symptoms (Level 1)
- Estrogen-alone for those without uterus
- Estrogen + progestogen for those with uterus (prevents endometrial hyperplasia)
- Appropriate, often lowest effective dose (Level 3)
- Low-dose vaginal estrogen: effective and safe for GSM, minimal systemic absorption (Level 1)
- For healthy symptomatic <60 yo or within 10 years of menopause: favorable CHD and mortality effects vs rare increased risks (Level 1)
- For >60 yo or >10-20 years from menopause: higher absolute risks (Level 1)
- Periodic reassessment individualized (Level 3)
- Absolute risks reduced for mortality, fractures, diabetes, breast cancer in <60 yo (Level 1)
- Long-term use in healthy, low-risk individuals >60 yo may be considered (Level 3)
- Does not need routine discontinuation at 60 or 65; longer durations beyond 65 should include periodic reevaluation (Level 3)
- Compounded bioidentical therapy: safety concerns (Level 1)

### FDA-Labeled Indications (p.18)
**Systemic:** Moderate-severe vasomotor symptoms

**Intravaginal (low systemic exposure):** Moderate-severe GSM symptoms (vaginal dryness, dyspareunia, atrophic vaginitis)

- 50% of patients >50 yo will develop osteoporosis
- Prevalence increases with age, more in women
- Highest fragility fracture rates: White American (17%), Hispanic American (14%), Black American (6%)
- 70% fractures in women, 30% in men
- Hip fractures most costly due to morbidity
- Underdiagnosed and undertreated

### Risk Factors (p.24)
- Low BMD
- Female sex
- Advanced age
- Race/ethnicity
- Previous fragility fracture (including radiographic vertebral)
- First-degree relative with osteoporotic fracture
- Low body weight or BMI
- Premature menopause
- Secondary osteoporosis
- Rheumatoid arthritis
- Past/present oral glucocorticoid therapy (prednisone ≥5 mg daily >3 months)
- Current smoking
- Alcohol ≥2 drinks/day
- Low calcium intake
- Low physical activity/immobilization
- Vitamin D insufficiency/deficiency
- Recent falls
- Cognitive impairment
- Impaired vision

### Low Bone Density (p.24-25)
- BMD is major fracture predictor
- Benefit of increasing peak bone mass in younger years
- Low BMD from:
  - Failure to reach normal peak bone mass
  - Bone loss
  - Both
- Genetics: 50-85% of peak bone mass variability
- Bone loss occurs when resorption exceeds formation
- Start losing bone mass in 3rd-4th decade
- Perimenopause/menopause: bone loss from increased resorption

### Falls (p.25)
- 90% hip fractures from falls in older patients
- Fall care is costly
- Risk factors overlap with osteoporosis/fracture risks
- Environmental factors: cords, rugs, poor lighting

### Bone Physiology (p.25)
**2 types:**
- Cortical: 80% of skeleton, mostly long bones
- Trabecular: mostly vertebrae and ends of long bones

**Composition:**
- Collagen: flexibility, energy-absorbing
- Mineral (calcium, phosphorus): stiffness, strength (50-70% bone mass)

**Peak bone mass:** Age 18-25 yo

### Medications Associated with Bone Loss/Fracture (p.25-26)
- Antiseizure therapy (phenytoin, carbamazepine, valproic acid)
- Aromatase inhibitors
- Calcineurin inhibitors (cyclosporine, tacrolimus)
- Glucocorticoids (long-term oral)
- GnRH agonists (leuprolide, goserelin) or analogs
- Heparin (unfractionated, long-term)
- Loop diuretics
- Medroxyprogesterone acetate depot (unknown fracture risk but ↓BMD)
- NRTIs (tenofovir disoproxil fumarate >other NRTIs)
- PPIs (long-term)
- SSRIs
- SGLT2 inhibitors (canagliflozin)
- Thiazolidinediones (pioglitazone, rosiglitazone)
- Thyroid - excessive supplementation
- Vitamin A - excessive chronic intake (>10,000 units retinol)

### Bone Remodeling (p.26-27)
- Occurs continuously throughout life
- Supports calcium homeostasis
- Osteoclasts resorb bone (resorptive phase)
- Osteoblasts form bone (formation phase)
- BMD decreases when resorption > formation
- Hormones influence remodeling

**Estrogen effects (males & females):**
- Maintain normal bone resorption rate
- Suppress osteoclast proliferation
- Increase osteoclast apoptosis

**Testosterone effects:**
- Direct and indirect on osteoblasts
- Metabolizes to estradiol → estrogen effects
- Increases osteoblast proliferation
- Increases muscle strength

### Postmenopausal Osteoporosis (p.27)
- Estrogen deficiency → bone density loss
- Increases osteoclast proliferation/activation
- Prolongs osteoclast survival
- Increases calcium excretion, decreases GI absorption
- Accelerated bone loss begins in perimenopause, continues up to 10 years after menopause
- Leads to vertebral and wrist fractures

### Male Osteoporosis (p.27)
- Lower risk due to: larger bones, greater peak bone mass, fewer falls, shorter life expectancy
- Less testosterone with aging → less conversion to estrogen
- Higher post-fracture mortality than women

**Common risk factors:**
- Smoking, alcohol abuse, low body weight, weight loss, age
- Long-term glucocorticoid use
- Androgen deprivation therapy
- Low testosterone

### Age-Related Osteoporosis (p.27)
- Accelerated bone turnover, reduced osteoblast formation
**Causes:**
- Hormone changes/deficiencies
- Calcium and vitamin D deficiencies
- Decreased body water
- Less exercise
- Increased hip fracture risk with aging
- Falls cause 87% fractures in older adults

### Clinical Presentation (p.27-28)

**General:** Many unaware until testing or fracture

**Symptoms:**
- Frequently asymptomatic
- Pain, immobility
- Depression, fear, low self-esteem

**Signs:**
- Shortened stature (>1.5 in loss from max height; >0.8 in loss in 1 year)
- Kyphosis or lordosis
- Fragility (low-trauma) vertebral, hip, wrist, or forearm fracture

**Lab tests (p.28):**
- CMP, 25(OH) vitamin D, TSH, CBC
- Total testosterone (men)
- 24-hour urine calcium and creatinine
- Bone turnover markers (serum NTX, CTX, PINP) - sometimes used
- Additional if history/exam suggests secondary cause

**Other tests:**
- Spine and hip BMD via central DXA
- VFA with DXA technology
- Radiograph (other reasons showing low BMD or confirm fracture)
- Balance and mobility tests

### Consequences (p.28)
- Fragility/low-trauma fractures
- Major osteoporotic fractures: vertebrae, hip, forearm, humerus → decreased QOL, increased morbidity/mortality
- Pain and physical deformity
- Severe kyphosis → respiratory/GI complications
- Depression
- Hip fracture: greatest morbidity/mortality (men higher 1-year mortality)
- Wrist fractures more common in younger postmenopausal women
- Risk of subsequent fracture increases exponentially
- Vertebral fractures: major predictor of future fracture
- Hip fracture: 2-10% chance of second hip fracture

### Patient Assessment (p.28)
- Lab tests (Table 112-4)
- Height annually
- Radiographs
- Tests for secondary causes
- Physical exam
- QOL questionnaires, risk factor tools, DXA

### Risk Assessment Tools (p.28-29)

**FRAX:**
- Most used tool
- 11 risk factors: age, sex, race/ethnicity, previous fracture, BMI, glucocorticoid use, current smoking, RA, parent hip fracture history, alcohol ≥3 drinks/day, secondary causes
- Calculates 10-year probability of major osteoporotic fracture and hip fracture

**Garvan tool:** Alternative option

### Screening Tools (p.29)
- Peripheral DXA
- Quantitative ultrasonography (QUS) - better fracture predictor than peripheral DXA
- NOT used for diagnosis or monitoring

### BMD Measurements (p.29)

**Purpose:** Assess fracture risk, diagnose osteoporosis, determine severity, confirm after low-trauma fracture

**Techniques:**
- DXA (central DXA preferred for therapeutic decisions)
  - Measurements at lumbar spine, femoral neck, total hip
  - Forearm alternative site
- QCT
- Digital x-ray radiogrammetry
- Radiographic absorptiometry

**Recommended in (p.29):**
- All women ≥65 yo
- All men ≥70 yo
- Postmenopausal women <65 yo with fracture risk
- Men 50-69 yo with fracture risk
- Secondary cause for bone loss

### Central DXA (p.29)
- Reports: bone density value, T-score, Z-score
- T-score used for diagnosis
- Follow-up: q1-3 years (some guidelines q5 years)
- Many insurance: q2 years

### Diagnosis (p.29)
- **Low bone mass (osteopenia):** T-score -1 to -2.5
- **Osteoporosis:** T-score ≤-2.5

### Treatment Goals (p.29-30)
- **Primary:** Osteoporosis prevention
- **Once low bone mass:** Improve/stabilize bone mass and strength, prevent fracture
- **With fracture:** Reduce pain/deformity, improve function, improve QOL, reduce future falls/fractures

### Treatment Indications (p.30)
**Prescription therapy for postmenopausal women or men ≥50 yo with:**
- Hip or vertebral fracture
- T-score ≤-2.5 at femoral neck, total hip, or spine
- T-score -1 to -2.5 with FRAX 10-year hip fracture risk ≥3% OR major osteoporotic fracture risk ≥20%

## OSTEOPOROSIS NONPHARMACOLOGIC THERAPY

### Bone-Healthy Lifestyle (p.30)
- Proper nutrition
- Moderate alcohol
- Smoking cessation
- Exercise
- Fall prevention

### Diet (p.30-31)
- Balanced nutrients and minerals
- Limited salt, alcohol, caffeine
- Adequate calcium and vitamin D
- Protein: 0.8 g/kg (adults), 1-1.2 g/kg (older adults), up to 1.5 g/kg (some chronic illnesses)
- Magnesium, boron, vitamin K: insufficient data
- Eating disorders → increased bone loss and fractures

### Calcium (p.31)

**Importance:** Bone development and maintenance

**Intake:** Based on age/gender; higher than RDA may be needed with certain diseases/medications

**Preferred sources:** Calcium-containing/fortified foods/beverages (dairy highest)

**Supplements:** If cannot achieve recommended intake through diet

**Adverse Effects:**
- Most common: constipation (treat with water, fiber, exercise)
- Calcium carbonate: gas, stomach upset
- Calcium citrate: less GI side effects
- Calcium + vitamin D: may cause kidney stones (increase fluids)

**Interactions:**
- Calcium carbonate with PPI/H2RA: ↓absorption → choose calcium citrate
- Calcium decreases absorption: iron, bisphosphonates, thyroid supplements

**Dosing:**
- Absorption dose-limited: max 500-600 mg elemental calcium per dose
- **Calcium carbonate:** salt of choice (highest elemental, least expensive)
  - Take with meals for better absorption
- **Calcium citrate:** take anytime, with or without food
- **Forms:** Tablets, chewable, dissolvable, liquid

### Vitamin D (p.31-32)

**Sources:**
- Sunlight
- Diet (vitamin D3: oily fish, eggs, fortified dairy; vitamin D2: fungi, eggs)

**Low vitamin D (p.31-32):**
- Higher rates: >60 yo, minorities, lower education, obese, inactive, current smokers
- Results from: insufficient intake, dietary fat malabsorption, decreased sun exposure, decreased skin production, decreased liver/renal metabolism

**Supplementation:**
- Most require supplements (especially older adults)
- Guidelines: treat to serum level ≥20 ng/mL or 30-50 ng/mL
- 700-800 units/day reduces hip and nonvertebral fractures

**Interactions:**
- Absorption decreased by: cholestyramine, colestipol, orlistat, mineral oil
- Increases aluminum absorption → avoid aluminum products

**Products:**
- Vitamin D3 and D2 both used; guidelines prefer D3
- Usually 1,000-2,000 units daily for osteoporosis
- Assess levels q3 months when indicated

### Calcium & Vitamin D Recommendations (p.32)

- Counsel on cessation

### Exercise (p.33-34)
- Increases bone mechanical strain → stimulates osteocytes → bone resorption → new stronger bone
- Weight-bearing exercise: increases muscle and bone mass
- Decreases fall risk
- Important early in life
- **Most beneficial:** Moderate-intensity weight-bearing, plyometric, resistance activities
- **Frequency:** 3-4x/week for 30-40 minutes

### Fall Prevention (p.34)
- Fall risk increases with age
- Older adults more likely: hip/pelvic fractures, fall backward/sideways
- Assess falls annually in older patients
- Review medications affecting cognition/balance
- Counsel on proper footwear, safe home environment

- With prior fracture: higher postmenopausal osteoporotic fracture risk
- Use pharmacologic therapy with caution; efficacy/safety not demonstrated

**Older Adults:**
- Falls more common
- Osteoporosis underdiagnosed
- Bone-healthy lifestyle, calcium, vitamin D
- When using medications, consider: remaining lifespan, ability to take/afford, cognitive function, swallowing, GI disorders, polypharmacy, desire to avoid meds, regimen complexity

**Chronic Kidney Disease (p.41):**
- Low BMD and fractures in CKD (GFR <60 mL/min), chronic dialysis, kidney transplant
- DXA underestimates fracture risk
- Fractures earlier, greater 1-year mortality
- Studies lacking
- **Denosumab:** Not renally eliminated, can use; monitor serum calcium
