## Disease State-Based Approach to Therapy (General Principles)

### Framework for Treating Infections (Page 1)

**Key Principles**:
1. **Have a working diagnosis**
   - Focus on treating infections, not just cultures!
2. **Identify likely pathogens** associated with that diagnosis
3. **Select optimal antibiotics** based on:
   - Likely pathogens
   - Penetration to site of infection
   - Coverage of resistant forms if frequent or patient unstable
   - Plan to de-escalate once definitive pathogen known
4. **Decide duration of therapy**

---

## Skin and Soft Tissue Infections (SSTI)

### The Usual Suspects (Pages 1-2)

**Most Common Organisms**:
- **S. aureus**
- **S. pyogenes (Group A Strep)**

**Common Disease States**:
- Impetigo
- Erysipelas (think Strep!)
- Cellulitis

**Clinical Pearl**: Always remember these as the "skin organisms"

### Streptococcus pyogenes (Page 1)

**Drug of Choice**: Penicillin
- Nearly universally susceptible
- Narrow spectrum therapy
- First choice if targeting S. pyogenes alone

**Important Notes**:
- Most Gram-positive agents reliably cover this organism
- Exception: Doxycycline does NOT cover S. pyogenes
- PCN allergy alternatives available

### Staphylococcus aureus (Pages 1-2)

**Historical Context**:
- Historically: MSSA expected unless risk factors present
- Current: Increase in community-acquired MRSA (CA-MRSA)

**When to Cover MRSA**:
- **Routine coverage**: Purulent cellulitis and abscesses
- Often covered in systemic infections even without these characteristics (but "just say no!")

### Oral Options for S. aureus (Pages 1-2)

**MSSA**:
- Amoxicillin/clavulanic acid
- Dicloxacillin
- Cephalexin
- (+ all MRSA options below)

**MRSA**:
- Doxycycline
- TMP/SMX
- Linezolid (and tedizolid)
- Clindamycin
  - **Remember**: Resistance issues, empirically unreliable

**Which also cover S. pyogenes?**
- All except doxycycline
- Some aren't comfortable with TMP/SMX, but should work well
- Clindamycin has resistance issues for Strep too

**Recommended Regimens**:
- **MSSA**: Cephalexin, Amoxicillin/Clavulanic Acid
- **MRSA**: TMP/SMX, doxycycline, linezolid
- **If MRSA of particular concern**: TMP/SMX or linezolid
- **Follow-up**: 24-48 hours prudent to assess success

### Agent Warnings (Page 2)

| Agent | Side Effects | Drug Interactions |
|-------|-------------|-------------------|
| Doxycycline | Photosensitivity | Chelation |
| TMP/SMX | Hypersensitivity, Hyperkalemia | Other agents that raise K+, warfarin |
| Amoxicillin/Clavulanic Acid | Allergic Reaction, GI ADE | |
| Linezolid | Platelet count | Serotonergic agents (SSRI) |
| Clindamycin | Diarrhea (and CDI) | |

### Severe Cellulitis (Page 2)

**Definition**:
- Failure of oral antibiotics and debridement
- Systemic symptoms

**IV Therapy Options**:

**MSSA/Strep only**:
- Nafcillin OR Cefazolin

**MRSA**:
- Vancomycin
  - Alternative: Daptomycin
- **Should only be used if indication for MRSA coverage or critically ill**

### Duration of Therapy (Page 2)

**Tailored to Clinical Scenario**:
- **5 days**: Shown effective in uncomplicated cellulitis
- **Up to 14 days**: If started IV (can step down to oral)
- **Longer**: If bone/joint involvement
- **Guideline recommendation**: 7 days for most patients

**Important**: Follow-up assessment crucial

---

## Animal Bites (Page 3)

### Epidemiology

- Account for ~1% of all ED visits
- Dog bites more common than cat bites
- **BUT: Cat bites more likely to get infected!**

### Microbiology

**Pathogens to Cover**:
- **Pasteurella multocida** (key organism!)
- Staph and Strep
- Anaerobes
- **Average**: 5 organisms per bite

**Important**: Pasteurella often has beta-lactamase that hydrolyzes early-generation penicillins and cephalosporins

### Treatment (Page 3)

**Indications**:
- If infection present
- Prophylactically in high-risk populations

**Drug of Choice**: Amoxicillin/clavulanic acid
- Covers Pasteurella, Staph, Strep, and anaerobes

**IV Options**:
- Ampicillin/Sulbactam
- 3rd generation cephalosporin

**Alternatives (PCN allergy)**:
- Doxycycline
- Moxifloxacin

**Human Bites** (and fist to mouth):
- Treat the same way (minus Pasteurella coverage)

---

## Diabetic Foot Ulcers (Page 3)

### Etiologic Agents

**Early/Superficial**:
- Gram-positive cocci → especially S. aureus (including MRSA) predominate

**Deep/Chronic Ulcers**:
- Gram-negative rods commonly seen
  - Enterobacteriaceae
  - P. aeruginosa? (sometimes)
  - Anaerobes? (sometimes)

**Critical**: Deep culturing is crucial (can be anything)

### Treatment Principles

**Important**: **Uninfected ulcers should NOT be treated!!!**

**Empiric Therapy**:
- IV therapy used (at least initially)
- Depends on depth of ulcer
- **Common regimen**: Vancomycin +/- Ceftriaxone (can vary)

### Duration of Therapy

- **1-2 weeks**: Mild infections
- **2-4 weeks**: Moderate to severe
- **4-6 weeks**: If bone involvement (osteomyelitis)
- **Do NOT need to treat until ulcer heals** - just until infection resolves!

---

## Urinary Tract Infections and Asymptomatic Bacteriuria

### UTI Terminology (Page 3)

**Cystitis**:
- Lower UTI, infection in the bladder

**Pyelonephritis**:
- Upper UTI, migrated to kidney +/- bacteremia

**Complicated UTI (cUTI)**:
- Has complicating factor → worse outcomes, longer duration needed

**Catheter-Associated UTI (CAUTI)**:
- UTI associated with urinary catheter (foley)

**Asymptomatic Bacteriuria**:
- Colonization with bacteria in urine, NO infection

### Cystitis (Pages 3-4)

**Primary Target Organism**: E. coli
- Other Gram-negatives, S. saprophyticus, Enterococcus also possible
- Empiric therapy directed at E. coli based on local susceptibility

**Duration of Therapy** (Antibiotic-Specific):

**3 days**:
- TMP/SMX
- Fluoroquinolones (remember, NO moxifloxacin for UTI!)

**5 days**:
- Nitrofurantoin

**7 days**:
- Beta-lactams

### Fosfomycin (Page 4)

**MOA**: Inhibits enolpyruvate transferase (early stage of peptidoglycan synthesis)

**Spectrum**: Many urinary Gram-negatives (and some Gram-positives), including drug-resistant isolates

**Dosing**:
- **Cystitis**: 3 g PO × 1 dose
  - **Note**: Recent evidence suggests inferior to nitrofurantoin
- **Complicated UTI**: Can give every 2-3 days (little evidence, but done)

**Advantages**:
- Safe for pregnancy
- Easy (single dose)
- Covers resistant organisms

**Recommendation**: Consider second-line

### What is a Complicated UTI (cUTI)? (Page 4)

**Definitions** (varies by source):
- "Structural or functional abnormality"
  - Obstruction (stones, tumor, narrowing)
  - Foreign body (catheter, stents)
  - Males
  - Pyelonephritis

**Recent Guidelines**: Define as "extending beyond the bladder"

**Impact**: Extends duration of therapy to **7+ days**

### Community-Acquired Pyelonephritis (Page 4)

**Organisms**: E. coli and other Gram-negatives

**Oral Options**:
- FQ, TMP/SMX (first-line)
- 3rd generation cephalosporins (limited data, not first choice)
- **NOT appropriate**: Nitrofurantoin and Fosfomycin (inadequate tissue levels)

**Duration**: 7-14 days
- Recent evidence moving towards shorter courses
- **7 days should be considered standard**, even with bacteremia
- Clinical response should dictate duration

**IV Therapy** (when patient initially hospitalized):
- FQ
- Aminoglycosides
- Ceftriaxone
- Extended-spectrum beta-lactams, carbapenems
  - When suspected or documented drug-resistant organism

**Target Therapy**:
- Against isolated pathogen(s)
- Can transition to oral to complete course

### Healthcare-Associated UTI (Page 5)

**Must Cover Resistant Pathogens** based on risk factors:

**Risk Factors**:
- Foley catheter, prolonged hospitalization → **P. aeruginosa**
- Nursing home, recent antibiotics → **ESBL**

**Empiric Coverage** (based on risk factors AND severity):
- Cefepime
- Piperacillin/Tazobactam
- Aminoglycosides
- Ciprofloxacin/Levofloxacin
- Carbapenems

### Asymptomatic Bacteriuria (Page 5)

**Definition**: Presence of bacteria in urine culture, with **NO symptoms** of infection

**Important Notes**:
- **Altered mental status doesn't count as symptom!**
- Even if pyuria present with bacteria, without another symptom → NOT indication for antibiotics
- Pyuria = non-specific marker for inflammation

**When to Treat** (ONLY two indications):
1. **Pregnancy**
2. **Undergoing urological procedure** (TURP)

**Consequences of Unnecessary Treatment**:
- Has NOT led to improvement in patient outcomes
- Has been associated with:
  - C. difficile infection
  - Increase in multidrug-resistant organisms
  - Medication side effects
  - **INCREASES in recurrent UTIs**

**Remember**: "Symptom-Free Pee: Let it be"

### Asymptomatic Bacteriuria Prevalence (Page 5)

| Population | Prevalence (%) |
|------------|----------------|
| Healthy, premenopausal women | 1.0-5.0 |
| Pregnant women | 1.9-9.5 |
| Postmenopausal women aged 50-70 | 2.8-8.6 |
| Diabetic patients (Women) | 9.0-27 |
| Diabetic patients (Men) | 0.7-11 |
| Elderly in community (≥70 yrs) - Women | 10.8-16 |
| Elderly in community (≥70 yrs) - Men | 3.6-19 |
| Elderly in long-term care - Women | 25-50 |
| Elderly in long-term care - Men | 15-40 |
| Spinal cord injuries - Intermittent catheter | 23-89 |
| Spinal cord injuries - Indwelling catheter | 57 |
| Hemodialysis patients | 28 |
| Indwelling catheter - Short-term | 9-23 |
| Indwelling catheter - Long-term | 100 |

*Also common in sexually active females

### Candiduria (Page 6)

**Clinical Significance**:
- Almost always represents **colonization** rather than active infection
- Very rarely warrants therapy

**Management**:
- Discontinue foley (if possible)
- Discontinue unnecessary antibiotics (if possible)

**If Need to Treat**:
- Options limited to:
  - Fluconazole
  - Amphotericin B

## Respiratory Tract Infections

### Overview (Page 6)

**Topics Covered**:
- Community-Acquired Pneumonia (CAP)
- Hospital-Acquired/Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia (HAP/VAP)
- COVID-19
- Influenza
- Upper Respiratory Tract Infections (URI)

### Community-Acquired Pneumonia (CAP) (Pages 6-7)

### Common Bacterial Pathogens

**"The Big 6"**:
1. S. pneumoniae
2. H. influenzae
3. M. catarrhalis
4. M. pneumoniae
5. C. pneumoniae
6. L. pneumophilia

**Others Warranting Consideration**:
- **S. aureus**
  - Increasing incidence of CA-MRSA
  - Post-influenza
  - Severe, necrotizing pneumonia
- **Anaerobes and aspiration**
  - Misconception that they are common players
  - Only need to cover when empyema or lung abscess present

**Scoring Systems**: CURB-65, PSI, PORT (dictate how/where to treat)

### Outpatient Therapy (Page 6-7)

**Otherwise Healthy Adults** (no comorbidities/risk factors):
- Amoxicillin OR Doxycycline
- **Macrolides no longer recommended**

**Presence of Comorbidities** (CHF; lung, liver, renal disease; DM) or recent antibiotic exposure:
- Beta-lactam + Doxycycline or Macrolide
  - Amoxicillin/clavulanate; 2nd/3rd gen cephalosporin
- **OR** Respiratory Fluoroquinolone

### Inpatient Therapy (Page 7)

**Non-Severe** (generally floor patients):
- Beta-lactam + Doxycycline or Macrolide
  - Ampicillin/sulbactam OR IV 3rd generation cephalosporin
  - Can transition to oral when stable
- **OR** Respiratory Fluoroquinolone

**Severe** (ICU patients):
- Same as above, but **tetracyclines aren't listed as option**
- Consider addition of vancomycin (not guideline recommendation)

### "So Long HCAP..." (Page 7)

**Historical Context**:
- Used to be category called "HCAP" (Healthcare-Associated Pneumonia)
  - Patients from community with risk factors for drug-resistant organisms
- These patients treated same as HAP/VAP
  - Led to lots of broad-spectrum antibiotic use
  - No data to support

**Current Approach** (HCAP went away in 2016):
- **Previous microbiology** is primary driver of when to cover MRSA, P. aeruginosa
- Recent hospitalization (or SNF/LTAC residence) + broad-spectrum antibiotic also considered
- **Detailed history, personalized approach is key**

### Duration of Therapy (Page 7)

**Huge Opportunity for Stewardship**:
- Michigan data shows >90% treated for excess duration

**Current Recommendations**:
- **Minimum**: 5 days of therapy
  - Afebrile × 48-72 hours
  - No more than 1 CAP-related sign of instability
    - Fever, Leukocytosis, Elevated heart rate or respiratory rate
- Patients discharged (or sent home from office/ED) almost always already meet criteria
- **Some recent data suggest 3 days may be sufficient**

### Hospital-Acquired/Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia (HAP/VAP) (Pages 7-8)

### Treatment Paradigm

**Key Principles**:
- From microbiology pathway, HAP and VAP considered same
  - Largely true, although VAP/ICU patients have more resistant microbiology
- **Start broad** (appropriate empiric therapy has mortality benefit)
- **Obtain cultures**
- **De-escalate therapy**
- **Optimize duration**

### Organisms of Concern (Page 8)

**Primary Targets**:
- **S. aureus** (MRSA needs covered, but MSSA there too)
- **P. aeruginosa**
- **E. coli and K. pneumoniae** (increasing ESBL consideration)
- **Enterobacter spp., Citrobacter spp., Serratia spp.**

**In Certain Units/Hospitals**:
- A. baumannii
- S. maltophilia

**Bottom Line**: Target resistant organisms, but individual institution pathway may vary based on organisms and severity of illness

### Empiric Therapy - General Approach (Page 8)

**Standard Regimen**:

**Vancomycin or Linezolid** (covering MRSA)

**PLUS**

**Anti-pseudomonal Beta-lactam** (e.g., Cefepime)

**PLUS/MINUS**

**Anti-pseudomonal Fluoroquinolone** (cipro/levo) **OR Aminoglycoside** (tobramycin)

### That's a General Rule, But... (Page 8)

**Patient-Specific Factors to Consider**:
- Drug allergies?
- History of resistant organisms?
- Just received two weeks of preferred anti-pseudomonal beta-lactam?

### HAP/VAP Empiric Therapy Table (Page 8)

| Setting | Recommended Regimen | Alternative (Piperacillin-tazobactam/Cefepime Exposure within 90 Days) | Alternative (Anaphylactic reactions to β-lactam) |
|---------|---------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| **HAP in floor patient admitted ≥ 48 hours** | Cefepime* 2gm IV every 8 hours plus vancomycin* IV PTD | Meropenem* 1gm IV every 6 hours plus vancomycin* IV PTD | Aztreonam* 2gm IV every 8 hours* plus vancomycin* IV PTD |
| **VAP or HAP in ICU patient admitted ≤ 48 hours** | Cefepime* 2gm IV every 8 hours plus vancomycin* IV PTD plus tobramycin* IV PTD | Meropenem* 1gm IV every 6 hours plus vancomycin* IV PTD plus tobramycin* IV PTD | Aztreonam* 2gm IV every 8 hours* plus vancomycin* IV PTD plus tobramycin* IV PTD |

*Dosing adjustments for renal function

### De-escalation Strategy: "You Started Broad, but Reel it in" (Page 8)

**Step 1**: If not MRSA, ditch the Gram-positive coverage

**Step 2**: Do I need to continue both Gram-negative drugs?
- What if it is P. aeruginosa?
  - Reasons for dual therapy:
    - In vitro synergy
    - Prevent resistance development
    - Improve empiric therapy coverage
- **Goal**: Streamline to single, narrowest spectrum agent possible

**Step 3**: Duration of Therapy
- **Historically**: 14-21 days
- **2003 study**: No difference in outcomes between 8-day vs. 15-day course in VAP
- **Current Guidelines**: **7 days**
  - Assumes initial clinical response and no complication

---

## COVID-19 (Page 9)

### General Principles

**Important**: Rapidly evolving treatment paradigm - pay attention to IDSA guidelines for latest recommendations

**Prevention**:
- Multiple extremely effective vaccines available
- **Prevention is key**

**Treatment Strategy**: Dependent on where patient is in course of illness
- **Early/Less severe**: Viral phase
- **Severe disease**: Hyperinflammatory phase

### Outpatient Treatment (Page 9)

**Goals**: Stop progression to hospitalization/death

**Oral Antivirals**:

**Nirmatrelvir/ritonavir (Paxlovid)**:
- **MOA**: Protease inhibitor; inhibits viral replication
- **ADE**: Dysgeusia (bitter, metallic taste) ≥5% of patients
- **DDI**: Ritonavir = CYP3A4 inhibitor → **MANY interactions** → check DDI databases

**Remdesivir**:
- **MOA**: RNA polymerase inhibitor; inhibits viral replication
- **IV only** → logistically challenging for outpatient use

**Molnupiravir**:
- **MOA**: RNA polymerase inhibitor
- **Relative contraindication**: Pregnant/pregnancy potential

### Hospitalized Treatment (Page 9)

**Breathing Room Air** (Moderate Disease):
- No therapy proven to benefit → supportive care
- High risk of progression → consider outpatient therapies

**Hypoxia - Requiring Supplemental Oxygen** (Moderate-Severe Disease):
- **Phase**: Pulmonary and/or hyperinflammatory
- **Goal**: Prevent progression and death, decrease time to resolution
- **Therapy**: Remdesivir, dexamethasone, +/- tocilizumab or baricitinib

**Invasive Mechanical Ventilation** (Critical Disease):
- **Phase**: Hyperinflammatory
- **Goal**: Save life
- **Therapy**: Dexamethasone, tocilizumab or baricitinib

---

## Influenza (Page 9)

### Key Points

**Prevention**:
- Vaccination is key
- Less efficacious than COVID-19 vaccines

**Treatment**:
- Modestly effective
- Limited agents
- **Must start early** in course of disease
- Decreases duration and severity of illness

**Agents**:
- **Oseltamivir**: Mainstay
- **Baloxavir**: Single-dose, recent approval

**Duration**: 5 days (critically ill patients may get longer courses)

---

## Acute Bronchitis (Pages 9-10)

### General Approach

**Key Point**: Vast majority of cases are **VIRAL**

**Treatment**:
- **Symptomatic treatment** is mainstay
- **Antimicrobial therapy usually NOT warranted**
  - Data shows no clinically meaningful benefit

### Exceptions (Positive Diagnostics For):

**B. pertussis**: Macrolides

**Influenza**: Oseltamivir

**Mycoplasma/Chlamydia**: Macrolide, doxycycline

---

## COPD Exacerbation (Page 10)

### Who Gets Antibiotics?

**Patients with Three Cardinal Symptoms**:
1. Increased dyspnea
2. Increased sputum volume
3. Increased sputum purulence

**OR**:
- 2 of 3 if one is increased purulence
- Patients requiring mechanical ventilation

### Causative Organisms

**"Our Old Friends the Respiratory Pathogens!"**:
- S. pneumoniae
- H. influenzae
- M. catarrhalis
- C. pneumoniae
- M. pneumoniae

### Treatment (Page 10)

**Oral Therapy** (Mild-Moderate Infection):
- Amoxicillin/clavulanic acid
- Doxycycline, Macrolides
- Respiratory fluoroquinolones

**IV Therapy** (Patients with Risk Factors for Poor Outcomes):
- Co-morbidities
- Severe COPD
- Frequent exacerbations

**Duration**: Driven by clinical improvement
- Typically 5-7 days

---

## Sinusitis (Page 10)

### General Principles

**Usually VIRAL**
- If bacterial, microbiology similar to respiratory pathogens

### Only Treat with Antibiotics If (ONE of the following):

1. **Persistence** of signs/symptoms for **>10 days** with no evidence of improvement
2. **Severe symptoms**: Fever >39°C + purulent nasal discharge or facial pain lasting **≥3-4 days**
3. **Worsening symptoms**

### Treatment

**Agents**:
- Amoxicillin/clavulanic acid
- Doxycycline
- Fluoroquinolones

**Duration**: 5-7 days

---

## Central Nervous System Infections

### Bacterial Meningitis - General Treatment Considerations (Page 10)

**Key Principles**:

1. **IV therapy at maximal doses**
   - Can possibly switch to highly bioavailable orals later

2. **Bactericidal therapy preferred**
   - Beta-lactams are mainstay
   - Evidence lacking for need for cidal therapy, but standard practice

3. **Blood-Brain Barrier (BBB)** decreases drug penetration (variable degree)

4. **Important to know organisms by patient population**

5. **Fast, appropriate therapy saves lives**

### Antibiotic Penetration into CNS (Page 11)

**Probably Sufficient**:
- Later generation cephalosporins (3rd/4th)
- Penicillin
- Ampicillin
- Vancomycin
- TMP/SMX
- Fluoroquinolones
- Metronidazole

**Probably Insufficient**:
- Tetracyclines
- Aminoglycosides
- Polymyxins

### Bacterial Meningitis by Age Group

### <1 Month of Age (Page 11)

**Organisms**:
- S. agalactiae (Group B Strep)
- E. coli
- L. monocytogenes
- Klebsiella spp.

**Important**: Children <1 month do NOT have intact BBB

**Empiric Therapy**:
- Ampicillin + gentamicin
- **OR** Ampicillin + cefotaxime (**avoid ceftriaxone!**)

### 1-23 Months of Age (Page 11)

**Organisms**:
- S. pneumoniae
- N. meningitidis
- S. agalactiae
- H. influenzae (maybe?)
- E. coli

**Empiric Therapy**:
- **Vancomycin + 3rd generation cephalosporin**

**Rationale for Vancomycin**:
- If mild resistance (elevated MICs) seen to 3rd gen cephalosporins in S. pneumoniae, generally not a problem
- However, due to variable BBB penetration, vancomycin added to cover "resistant" S. pneumoniae

### 2-50 Years of Age (Page 11)

**Organisms**:
- N. meningitidis
- S. pneumoniae
- H. influenzae?

**Empiric Therapy**:
- **Vancomycin + 3rd generation cephalosporin**

**Adjunctive Therapy**:
- Patients should receive **dexamethasone**

### Dexamethasone in Meningitis (Page 11)

**Dosing**: 10 mg IV q6h × 4 days

**Rationale**:
- Decrease inflammation in subarachnoid space
- Decrease neurologic sequelae

**Timing**: Give **PRIOR to first antibiotic dose**
- If received antibiotics already, do NOT administer

**Evidence**: Inconsistent mortality benefit in literature, but thought to outweigh possible immune suppression

### >50 Years of Age (Page 11)

**Organisms**:
- S. pneumoniae
- N. meningitidis
- L. monocytogenes

**Empiric Therapy**:
- **Vancomycin + 3rd generation cephalosporin + ampicillin**
  - Ampicillin added to cover Listeria

### Listeria monocytogenes (Page 11)

**Remember**: HELPS bug

**Drug of Choice**: Ampicillin

**Alternative Options**:
- TMP/SMX (good efficacy data)
- Meropenem
- Gentamicin sometimes added as adjunctive therapy, but "this is silly"

### Remembering Bacterial Meningitis Pathogens (Pages 11-12)

**For Most Patients**:
- Most causative pathogens are **S. pneumoniae** and **N. meningitidis**
- 3rd generation cephalosporins (high dose!) would cover majority
- Vancomycin added (high dose!) to cover potential pneumococcal issues with ceftriaxone
  - **If causative pathogen NOT S. pneumoniae with elevated MIC → stop vancomycin!**

**Extremes of Age**:
- Need coverage for Listeria

**Neonates**:
- Avoid ceftriaxone

**Duration**: Varies by bug - most 7-21 days

### Prophylaxis (Page 12)

**N. meningitidis**:
- **Who**: Household contacts and those exposed to oral secretions
- **Treatment**:
  - Ciprofloxacin × 1 (first-line)
  - Alternatives: Rifampin (2 days), Ceftriaxone IM

**H. influenzae**:
- **Who**: Everyone in household with unvaccinated children
- **Treatment**: Rifampin

### Special Populations: CNS Shunt Infections (Page 12)

**Organisms**:
- Most commonly skin organisms
- **Coagulase-negative staphylococci** (most common)
- Others: S. aureus (total staph ~75%), GNR, streptococci

**Treatment**:
- Gram stain for pathogens
- Start broad-spectrum antibiotics
  - **Common**: Vancomycin + Cefepime
  - Intraventricular antibiotics may be used as adjunct

**Management**:
- **Remove shunt if possible** (failure rate remains high with antibiotics alone)
- Clear cultures
- Treat 7-21 days
- Replace shunt

---

## Intra-abdominal Infections

### Normal Enteric Flora (Page 12)

**Composition**:
- **Anaerobes >>> Aerobes** (99% vs 1%)

**99% Anaerobes**:
- Bacteroides
- Clostridium
- Peptostreptococci

**1% Aerobes**:
- E. coli
- Proteus
- Klebsiella
- Enterococcus

**Important Notes**:
- **Enterococcus**: Present but not routinely targeted empirically
  - If cultured, then cover (sometimes)
- **Streptococci**: Also present in GI tract, but all regimens cover well

### Enteric Flora: Things to Know! (Pages 12-13)

**B. fragilis** (Most Resistant Anaerobe):
- **Good coverage**: Penicillin/BLI, carbapenems, metronidazole
- **Good enough**: Cefoxitin, moxifloxacin
- **Just say no**: Clindamycin

**E. coli**:
- Varies greatly from location to location
- **Important**: Know local susceptibility
- 2nd/3rd generation cephalosporins common empiric choice, but can differ!

### Community-Acquired vs Hospital-Acquired (Page 13)

**Community-Acquired**:
- Susceptible Gram-negative organisms
- Anaerobes
- Enterococcus (not necessary for empiric coverage)

**Hospital-Acquired**:
- Recent antimicrobial exposure (most common) OR failing therapy
- Targets: P. aeruginosa, ESBL, Enterococcus, Candida spp.

### Spontaneous (Primary) Bacterial Peritonitis (SBP) (Page 13)

**Pathophysiology**:
- Common complication in patients with impaired liver function
- Cirrhosis → ascites → bacterial translocation

**Most Common Organisms**:
- E. coli
- Streptococcus spp.
- Klebsiella pneumoniae

**Treatment**:
- **Mainstay**: 3rd generation cephalosporins
- **Duration**: 5-7 days

**Prophylaxis** (High risk or history of SBP):
- TMP/SMX 5 days/week
- **OR** Ciprofloxacin once weekly

### Intra-Abdominal Infections: Others (Page 13)

**Includes**: Abscesses, ruptured bowel, cholangitis

**Normal Flora**: B. fragilis, E. coli (as previously discussed)

**Community-Acquired Infection**:
- 1st/2nd/3rd gen cephalosporin + metronidazole
- **OR** Cefoxitin
- FQ + metronidazole (alternative for allergy, but **suboptimal!**)

**Nosocomial/Critically Ill Community-Acquired**:
- Expand coverage:
  - Cefepime/MTZ
  - Piperacillin/tazobactam
  - Carbapenem

### Acute Cholecystitis (Page 13)

**Important**: Often an **inflammatory**, but **NOT infectious** condition

**Treatment Approach**:
- Given to most (all) patients
- However, in patients lacking systemic inflammatory response, need remains unclear
- **If patient lacks systemic symptoms AND gallbladder removed**: Can d/c antibiotics in 24 hours

**Microbiology**: Same bugs and drugs as other intra-abdominal infections

### Intra-Abdominal Infections: Duration of Therapy (DOT) (Page 13)

**No Hard and Fast Rule**

**If Removable Focus + Source Control** (KEY):
- RCT data support **4-5 days** of therapy
- **This is the guideline recommendation**

**If No Source Control**:
- Allow clinical response to dictate:
  - Resolution of signs and symptoms
  - Improvement on imaging

---

## C. difficile Infection (Pages 13-14)

### Treatment Approach (Page 14)

**Should Include Discontinuing Exacerbating Causes**:
- Broad-spectrum antibiotics (if possible)
- Acid-suppressive agents

**Historical Treatment**:
- Metronidazole was drug of choice
- **Almost never recommended anymore** - inferior

### Current Mainstays of Therapy (Page 14)

**Fidaxomicin** (superior, but costly)

**Oral Vancomycin**

**Duration**: 10-14 days (for first occurrence; after that it gets complicated)

**Recurrence**: Common; increasing role of fecal microbiota therapy (FMT)

### Fidaxomicin (Page 14)

**MOA**: Inhibits RNA synthesis by inhibiting RNA polymerases

**Spectrum**: **EXTREMELY narrow** - really focusing on Clostridium

## Sexually Transmitted Infections (STI)

### Overview (Page 14)

**Categories**:
1. **Genital Ulcer Conditions**: Chancroid, Genital Herpes, Syphilis
2. **Urethritis and Cervicitis**: Chlamydia, Gonorrhea
3. **Vaginosis**: Trichomoniasis
4. **Pelvic Inflammatory Disease**

### Chancroid (Page 14)

**Causative Organism**: Haemophilus ducreyi

**Characteristics**: Painful ulcers

**Co-infections**: Possibility for HSV, syphilis, HIV

**Goals**: Cure infection, resolve symptoms, prevent transmission

**Treatment Options**:
- Azithromycin 1 g PO × 1 dose
- Ceftriaxone IM
- Ciprofloxacin × 3 days
- Topical erythromycin × 7 days

**Partner Treatment**: Treat regardless of symptoms if sexual contact within 10 days of partner's symptoms

### Genital Herpes (Herpes Simplex Virus) (Pages 14-15)

**Nature**: Chronic, life-long viral infection
- Recurrences much more likely in HSV-2
- Drugs neither eradicate latent virus nor affect risk/frequency/severity after discontinuation

**Treatment: First Clinical Episode** (Page 14):
- Acyclovir × 7-10 days
- **Valacyclovir** (offers twice-daily dosing vs 3-5 with others!)

**Recurrent Infections** (Page 15):

**Suppressive Therapy**:
- Reduces frequency 70-80% in patients with frequent (≥6) episodes/year
- Many patients will have NO outbreaks
- Can decrease likelihood of transmission
- **Valacyclovir once daily**

**Episodic Regimens**:
- 5-day course

**Severe Disease** (Page 15):
- **Disseminated infection**: Pneumonitis, hepatitis, meningitis, encephalitis
- **IV Acyclovir**: 5-10 mg/kg q8h
- Usually start IV, then transition to PO valacyclovir once stable (complete 10-day course)

**Management of Sexual Partners**: Counseling!

### Syphilis (Page 15)

**Causative Organism**: T. pallidum

**Various Manifestations**:

**Primary Infection**: Ulcer/chancre at infection site

**Secondary Infection**: Skin rash, mucocutaneous lesions, lymphadenopathy

**Tertiary Infection**: Cardiac/ophthalmic manifestations, auditory abnormalities

**Latent Infection**: Lack clinical symptoms, but positive serology

**Key Point**: **Penicillin is preferred agent for ALL stages of syphilis**
- Different formulation/dosage/duration for different manifestations

**Treatment by Stage**:

**Primary/Secondary**:
- Benzathine penicillin IM × 1

**Latent Syphilis**:
- Goal: Prevent late complications
- Same as above
- If late latent: 3 doses at 1-week intervals

**Tertiary Syphilis**:
- Same 3-dose regimen as late-latent

**Neurosyphilis**:
- CNS involvement at any stage
- High-dose IV penicillin

### C. trachomatis (Page 15)

**Treatment Options**:
- **Doxycycline 100 mg PO BID × 7 days**
- Azithromycin 1 g orally × 1

**Recent Evidence** (Guidelines updated July 2021):
- MSM: Doxycycline superior for rectal chlamydia
- **Doxycycline now first-line**

**Sex Partners**:
- Should be evaluated if sexual contact in last 60 days

**Abstinence**:
- Need to abstain until treatment completed
- **7 days, even if Azithromycin!**

### N. gonorrhea (Pages 15-16)

**Uncomplicated Gonococcal Infections** (Cervicitis, Urethritis):
- **Ceftriaxone 500 mg IM × 1** (≥150 kg = 1 gram)
- **PLUS Doxycycline 100 mg PO × 7 days** (unless chlamydia ruled out)

**Disseminated Gonococcal Infection (DGI)** (Page 16):
- Septic arthritis, endocarditis, meningitis
- Full-dose 3rd generation cephalosporins (IV)
- Duration depends on site

### Vaginosis (Page 16)

**Three Main Categories**:

**Bacterial**: Anaerobes like G. vaginalis
- **Treatment**: Metronidazole × 7 days

**Trichomoniasis**: T. vaginalis
- **Treatment**: Metronidazole 2 g PO × 1 dose

**Candidiasis**: C. albicans
- **Treatment**: Fluconazole × 1 dose (or variety of topicals)

### Pelvic Inflammatory Disease (PID) (Page 16)

**Causative Organisms**:
- N. gonorrhea
- C. trachomatis
- Some Gram-negative organisms
- Anaerobes
- Maybe even Strep!

**Empiric Recommendation**:
- **Cefoxitin + doxycycline**

**Transition to Oral**:
- If mild-to-moderate disease OR clinical response seen
- Can transition to oral covering same organisms
